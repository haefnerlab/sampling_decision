# sampling_decision

A model of perceptual decision-making (2-AFC) with neural sampling

S_Experiment runs the main program. It takes one parameter, a struct that is generated by running S_Exp_Para. S_Exp_Para takes one argument, a string that must match a case present in the file. Feel free to add cases as needed. Once this struct is gneerated, it can be passed to S_Experiment. Sampling_Gibbs_InPlace_fast_e performs gibbs sampling on a generated image to infer a decision about the orientation of a gabor filter present in the image, and is called directly from S_Experiment.
