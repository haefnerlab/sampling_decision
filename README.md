# sampling_decision
A model of perceptual decision-making (2-AFC) with neural sampling
S_Experiment_edited runs the main program. It takes one parameter, a struct that is generated by running S_Exp_Para. The details of the struct cna be edited simply by editing the script in that file. Sampling_Gibbs_InPlace_fast_e performs gibbs sampling on a generated image to infer a decision aboutthe orientation of a gabor filter present in the image.
